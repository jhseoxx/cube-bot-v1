# cube-bot-v1

## Source code for V1 of cube club bot; Feel free to edit, use, download 
The code can work via hosting directly from your computer (i do beta testing using vsc lol) or hosting via a server/ cloud server. 

These are relatively low cost (ish), as long as the bot you plan to make isn't overly advanced or has many many daily users (in the thousands maybe). 
The free stuff can be a bit slow (and needs resets here and there), if you want instantaneous performance I recommend looking into hosting on Heroku
