# cube-bot-v1

## DISCLAIMER
Not a compsci or any software engineering (ergo anything that has to do with programming stuff) so the code is likely to be very amateur and scuffed to the professional eye. Some processes **can** be made more efficient but I will leave that up to if you are interested in improving the code for yourself.

## Source code for V1 of cube club bot
The code can work via hosting directly from your computer (i do beta testing using vsc lol) or hosting via a cloud server.

These are relatively low cost (ish), as long as the bot you plan to make isn't overly advanced or has many many daily users (in the tens of thousands maybe, in this case expect some costs). 
The free stuff can be a bit slow (and needs resets here and there), if you want instantaneous performance I recommend looking into hosting on Heroku or just self hosting as long as you have a decent computer.

Please remember to replace `"TOKEN"` and `"bot_name"` with your own; do not reveal the token to anyone.
To send split requests to a dedicated channel, replace `[CHAT ID]` with the ID of your chat. You can obtain this ID using this bot @MissRose_bot

I don't ever plan to touch the V1 code as I have deployed the V2 that is more streamlined and advanced. Feel free to edit, use, download this 

## Features
1. Systematic way of receiving and viewing split requests from buyers
2. The bot self organises those details and sends them to a dedicated group chat or channel

If you want to add additional features to your bot the main pieces of code are really quite copy-paste. But if you want
